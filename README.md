# Image Classification with SVM and H.O.G.

As humans, it's easy to identify differences between two subjects. How does a machine tell them apart? One such way is through Support Vector Machines (SVM), a supervised learning model that analyzes data used for classification and regression tasks. In this, I have trained a SVM for classifying images of cats and dogs by extracting Histogram of Oriented Gradients (H.O.G.) features from the input. Notably, we can use the model on any new image that we upload!
